👋 Hi there, I’m Chamith Dilshan Kahandawala
🚀 Passionate Tech Explorer | Full-Stack Developer in the Making
🔭 I’m diving deep into Full-Stack Development with React, Spring Boot, and MongoDB.
🌱 Always curious, I’m expanding my Mobile App Development and Embedded Systems skills.
💡 I’m interested in Software Engineering, Weightlifting, and Tech Innovations that make life easier.
🤝 Open to collaborating on web development projects, IoT-based solutions, and creative tech ideas.
⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you’ll find me smashing weights as the Vice Captain of the University of Kelaniya’s Weightlifting Team! 🏋️‍♂️
